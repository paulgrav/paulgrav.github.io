		<a href="https://grav.social/2024/09/06/thoughts-on-the.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-09-06 06:50:17 &#43;0000">Sep 6, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The first thing I tried to do in the new <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id6475002485">Reeder</a> app was to try to add my Feedbin account. I couldn’t. I wondered whether it was hidden somewhere in the new UI or perhaps it was behind an in-app purchase. It was neither, adding Feedbin and other similar services was intentionally deprecated. Whilst I’m still not sure that this change is the best fit for my needs, this could be make the on-boarding experience far easier for new users.</p>
<p>I exported an OPML file from Feedbin and imported it into new Reader, and I now have something that’s similar to what I had in Reeder Classic.</p>
<p>Another controversial change will inevitably be the move to subscription pricing. £1 per month or £10 for 12 months. I prefer this for two reasons 1) it’s a small investment to try out the full version. All the features for one month for only £1, and if I don’t like it I can cancel the subscription 2) the subscription model gives the developer a consistent income which makes me feel like the app is less likely to become abandonware at some point.</p>
<p>Overall it looks like a very promising new app. I’m going to give it a go and see if I prefer it over Reeder Classic.</p>

			 <p>I see lots of people struggling to set their HR zones on their Garmin watches and this leads to all manner of weird issues. Setting zones should be simple.</p>
<p>First off, what not to do? I would caution against using 220-age to find your max HR. I think that formula may work well for studying large groups of individuals but I suspect doesn’t work well for individuals. Much like BMI.</p>
<p>Max HR or Lactate threshold HR? I think finding max HR is problematic. Max HR will change depending on your training status. If you’re at the end of a heavy block of training, you may not be able to achieve max HR. Finding your max HR isn’t pleasant either. I think it’s better to use LTHR, in my experience, it doesn’t vary much. Most importantly, I think LTHR is more useful, it’s the threshold beyond which your rate of fatigue increases.</p>
<h3 id="step-1--determine-your-lthr">Step 1 — determine your LTHR</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.trainingpeaks.com/learn/articles/joe-friel-s-quick-guide-to-setting-zones/">Joel Friel provides good advice</a> for establishing your LTHR.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To find your LTHR do a 30-minute time trial all by yourself (no training partners and not in a race). Again, it should be done as if it were a race for the entire 30 minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>at 10 minutes into the test, click the lap button on your heart rate monitor. When done, look to see what your average heart rate was for the last 20 minutes. That number is an approximation of your LTHR.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This weekend <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/11392159803">I ran the Leeds Half-Marathon</a>. My average HR for the 85 minutes was 161bpm. I could use that as my LTHR or I could let <a href="https://intervals.icu">intervals.icu</a> tell me, which it did. I think either value would work fine.</p>

<h3 id="step-2--personalise-your-zones">Step 2 — personalise your zones</h3>
<p>Then I use <a href="https://support.garmin.com/en-GB/?faq=w8qlOr7BQ16Z82HVrevpw9">Garmin Connect to set my zones in my device’s user profile</a>.</p>
<p>My zones happen to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Z1 -73%</li>
<li>Z2 74-86%</li>
<li>Z3 87-97%</li>
<li>Z4 98-100%</li>
<li>Z5 101-</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/zone-2-training-for-endurance-athletes/">Zone 2</a> is where I spend most of my training time and is the most important one for me. I did tweak my Z2 range from the defaults. 74-86% of 163 is 120-140bpm and I know I’m still able to breathe easily and have a conversation in this zone.</p>
<p>That’s all there is to it when setting heart rate zones.</p>

			 <p>I’ve been a long time <a href="https://www.meetcarrot.com/weather/">Carrot</a> user but decided to give <a href="https://contrast.co/weather-up/">Weather Up 3.0</a> a try after <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2024/02/29/ep-396">hearing the developer on The Talk Show podcast</a> and reading about <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/01/weather-up">Weather Up on Daring Fireball</a>.</p>
<p>The widget is information rich and I prefer it over any of Carrot’s widgets. The app isn’t as feature-rich as Carrot’s and it has a few things that are jarring.</p>
<p><img src="/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75,width=300,height=121/uploads/2024/img-2515.jpeg" width="300" height="121" alt="Screenshot of Weather Up’s widget"

<p>If you’re not from the US you might be wondering if this app is for me. On the first opening, you will notice that the default cities are all US cities. Time formatting is hardcoded to 12h (you can’t change it, you’re stuck with it) and temperature defaults to Fº. The app does provide its own setting to switch from Fº to Cº but I don’t understand why the developer couldn’t the temperature units defined in iOS’s regional settings. Even the search skews towards US cities.</p>

<p>I sent feedback regarding the time issue to the developer and it took a month to receive a response. Since the app’s release 3 months ago there have been 2 minor updates.</p>
<p>It’s a good app. It would be great if the issues above could be addressed. It’s a shame I can’t tell if the app is still in active development.</p>
<p>For now I’m going to stick with Carrot. I really liked Weather Up’s widget. It did provide value but not sufficient enough to justify £40 pa. or £4 pcm.</p>

			 <p>I <a href="https://grav.social/2024/04/07/setting-up-garmin.html">previously mentioned</a> how to setup Garmin Pay with any UK bank card using Curve.</p>
<p>I setup both a debit card and my credit card with Curve and about a week ago Curve started blocking all transactions. The other issue is that I can’t add Curve to anymore of my Apple Pay—supporting devices either.</p>
<p>Looking at the recents reviews in the App Store, I’m not the only one who has experienced this problem.</p>
<p>In addition to the card not functioning as a card, the support is non-existant.</p>
<p>I paid £6 for a week of using Curve. I’m kinda glad that’s the extent of my loss.</p>
<p>On the basis of the lack of support, I would recommend no one use Curve. Stay away.</p>

			 <p><strong>UPDATED</strong> <a href="https://grav.social/2024/04/15/curve-stopped-working.html">Don’t use Curve</a>.</p>
<p>Garmin Pay, unlike Apple Pay, is not widely supported in the UK. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/109516">Apple Pay in the UK</a> is supported by over 150 financial institutions. Garmin Pay is <a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/garminpay/banks/">supported by 12</a>. Apple Pay is one of my favourite features on Apple Watch.</p>
<p>I wanted to make the switch to my new <a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/p/894067/pn/010-02803-11">Garmin Epix Gen2 Pro</a> as smooth as possible and I was worried that I was going to miss out on the ability to pay for goods with my watch.</p>
<p>There’s a way around Garmin Pay’s poor support. <a href="https://www.curve.com/en-gb/">Curve</a>. Curve is a service that acts as a proxy for your various credit and debit cards. You add your cards to Curve. Add Curve to your Garmin watch. Then pay for goods with your Garmin Watch. Curve then works out which card to use.</p>
<p>Setting up Curve was simple with their iOS app. You have an account set up in about 5mins and then all that’s left to do is to add Curve to Garmin Pay.</p>
<p>Paying with an Apple Watch is a case of double-clicking the side button. It’s a shame that Garmin’s default isn’t as slick.    You have to hold the light button, enter the controls menu, and press up/down multiple times to find the wallet icon. Garmin lists 7 separate steps in the Epix manual. There is an easier way. I configured a Hot Key so that a long press on START opens Garmin Pay. That’s one step instead of 7.</p>
<p>Curve has a couple of interesting features that I want to explore further. The first one is Smart Rules. You can configure one or two rules (you have to pay for more) to determine which cards will be used for payment. The second is Anti-Embarrassment Mode, where you can use a backup card if your Monzo account is empty.</p>
<p>Over the past week I’ve been using Garmin Pay with the Garmin Epix and the experience has been on a par with Apple Pay, which is all I would have wanted.</p>

			 <p>Whilst in El Chalten and Bariloche I knew we wanted to do hikes. Over the 4 days of hiking, I used a combination of apps to help us enjoy our hikes. I’ve listed the 3 below and described what I liked about each of them.</p>
<p>My requirements were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trail discovery. I wanted to find the best trails and maximise our time.</li>
<li>Downloadable maps. I wasn’t sure I’d have any network coverage</li>
<li>Works on both iPadOS and iOS. I wasn’t going to take my laptop with me. Planning on the iPad is easier than on the phone.</li>
</ul>
<p>My requirements didn’t include navigation or recording since my Garmin Instinct series 2 would cover this.</p>
<h2 id="gaia-gps">Gaia GPS</h2>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1201979492">App Store link</a></p>
<img src="/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,height=1300/uploads/2024/img-2196.png" width="600" height="1300" alt="Gaia Screenshot" loading="lazy">
<p>Gaia has the prettiest maps out of the three apps I tried. I downloaded maps for El Chalten, El Calafate, and Bariloche. Whilst the UI for downloading was clunky, it worked. Gaia offered an iPadOS version and a web version for its maps.</p>
<p>I found Gaia easy to use and reliable during hikes. It was easy to figure out which turns to take, and how much of our hike was left.</p>
<p>I ended up paying £51.90 for 12 months of access to their mapping.</p>
<h2 id="all-trails">All Trails</h2>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id405075943">App Store link</a></p>
<img src="/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,height=1300/uploads/2024/img-2197.png" width="600" height="1300" alt="All Trails Screenshot" loading="lazy">
<p>Whilst Gaia had beautiful maps, All Trails helped us decide where we wanted to go. They have lots of trail reviews and pictures.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, All Trails doesn’t offer an iPadOS version and for that reason chose Gaia GPS over All Trails for downloading maps.</p>
<p>All Trails is an App Store Award-winning app, winner of the iPhone App of the Year. I can see why, the app has a great UX.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-explore">Garmin Explore</h2>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1276675721">App Store Link</a></p>
<img src="/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,height=1300/uploads/2024/img-2198.png" width="600" height="1300" alt="Garmin Explore Screenshot" loading="lazy">
<p>I wish I had discovered this app before our vacation. The maps themselves don’t look as good as either All Trails or Gaia, but the necessary detail is there. And it’s <strong>free</strong>.</p>
<p>Its killer feature is the tight integration with my Garmin Instinct. During an active hike activity on the watch, I could open Garmin Explore, find a destination on a trail, Garmin Explore would create the course, sync it to the watch and start navigating. Seamlessly. Then I could see ETA, estimated time remaining, and ascent remaining on my watch without having to take my phone out of my pocket. It worked great.</p>
<p>Garmin Explore has an iOS and iPadOS version. It’s available on the web via <a href="http://explore.garmin.com">explore.garmin.com</a> The maps are downloadable by region, so it’s easy to download everything you need before hitting the trails.</p>

<p><a href="https://barilocheturismo.gob.ar/en/short-circuit">Circuito Chico</a> is a ~20km road that is ~20km from downtown Bariloche. It is one of the main attractions in the area and offers spectacular scenery and it’s from there that you can access <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonia_Suiza">Colonia Suiza</a>. A picturesque Swiss-style village. Cycling the Circuito Chico is often suggested as the best way to experience it as opposed to driving. My wife and I recently visited Bariloche and completed the Circuito Chico on bikes but it ended up being a day of frustration rather than one of relaxing in a gorgeous location.</p>
<p>Don’t cycle from Bariloche to Circuito Chico! It’s a ~40km round trip from downtown Bariloche and is not worth the time and effort. You might think, like I did, what could ruin a 40km ride near the banks of the nearby lake?</p>
<ol>
<li>The vast majority of bikes available for hire are mountain bikes. The bikes are heavy, the tires are slow MTB tires. A gravel bike would have been ideal. An e-gravel bike would have been better. I didn’t spot either of those along the way.</li>
<li>You can’t see much of the lake along the way, so the ride isn’t very interesting.</li>
<li>Worse. The road is busy. The good news is that the cars give you space. The bad news is that the buses don’t, they expect you to ride in the dirt. One bus passed me so close that I could touch the side of the bus.</li>
</ol>
<p>
It took us almost 2hrs to cycle 20km to Circuito Chic and by then we felt like we’d had enough. The stiff headwind didn’t help either
</p>
<p>My advice would be to drive or grab a public bus to Circuit Chico. Then hire an e-bike at the start point. Circuito Chico is not flat! It has numerous short climbs with some tough gradients. Yes, we had a tailwind on the way back but by then we were too spent to enjoy it.</p>

			 <p>TLDR: Bring dollars!</p>
<p>I knew the Argentina would present some unique problem when visiting due to the country’s financial problems. Inflation was over 200% and the peso was artificially pegged the dollar. Ahead the trip we bought $1000, a bit more than what we needed. I figured any currency leftover can be used for future trips to countries were the dollar is in demand.</p>
<p>On arrival we found using ATMs to be problematic in Argentina. The maximum withdrawl amount was capped at $15000 ARS and the charge to withdraw was over $8000 ARS. At the time $15000 was the equivalent of around 15 GBP. Not great.</p>
<p>Almost everywhere accepted contactless payment. I either used Apple Pay or Monzo card to pay for things. For everything else we used ARS, and dollars when we were short of ARS. Tipping is expected in the restaurants when service isn’t items on the bill/check/cuenta. The $1000 notes came in handy there.</p>
<p>In Buenos Aires there were plenty of people offering ”cambio”, but as a foreigner this didn’t feel like the safest option. The additional risk didn’t feel like it was worth the offer of a better exchange rate. Instead we used official cambios that offered us a "turista” rate that was marginally better than what the local were offered.</p>
<p>In hindsight I think we got things right. I’d recommend bringing dollars, and find a cambio to buy pesos when you have the opportunity.</p>

<p>Matt Fitzgerald’s training plan was the basis of my training the previous year. For no good reason I chose Pfitzinger’s 18 week 55-70mile plan this time round. </p>
<p>Training was punctured with multiple vacations, poor me. I struggled to find/make the time in my routine to get the med-long runs done. In the end my training consistency wasn’t where it needed to be. That said, I did manage to achieve the necessary running volume during the weeks prior to the race. </p>
<p>I was also nursing a knee injury that impaired my ability to get the volume of running done.</p>
<h2>Pre-race</h2>
<p>For the taper, I tried to follow what I had done the previous year since that clearly worked. The exception was that I sprinkled in some hard VO2max bike workouts.
I’ve been monitoring my HRV throughout the summer and I was puzzled why my watch was telling me that I was strained. Completely the inverse of what I expected and made me worry that my immune system was under some sort of stress that was unknown to me.</p>
<h2>Race</h2>
<p>Temp at the start was 15° on a clear sunny day. Towards the end it was near 21°. </p>
<p>0-2km Felt good. Ran to RPE. Pace was a comfortable 4m00s.</p>
<p>3-21km Pace dropped to 4m10s. HR was higher than I would have liked to be. Last year it was a few beats above 150, now it was approaching 160. Too close to threshold but I didn’t want to slow down since RPE felt fine. </p>
<p>21-28km The beginning of the end. Maintaining my target pace was becoming more challenging. My hip was starting to hurt. I could feel signs of cramp in my calves. I wasn’t enjoying it anymore. </p>
<p>28-30km Pace dropped to 4m30s. I was fighting my body to keep the target pace. The hip pain was getting worse and I was starting to limp. By 30km the discomfort was too much and I had to walk. It didn’t take me long to come to terms that all the training I’d done wasn’t sufficient. 12k to go, what do I do now? The answer was simple, try to jog to the finish and enjoy the beautiful autumn day in Bucharest. </p>
<p>30-39km No question it was a slog. At 35km I could feel that my cardio had enough.</p>
<p>39-42km Casa Parlamentului was now visible. The end was in sight. I managed to push a little harder and run a couple of final sub-6m/km. </p>
<h2>The event</h2>
<p>The route was nice. It passed the nicer areas of Bucharest. România in Autumn is beautiful. Temperatures are pleasant.
There were a lot fewer runners than at Paris. 600-800 versus the 18000 at Paris. I was frequently running alone.
The atmosphere was spartan to say the least. I appreciated the few people who took the time to cheer us on.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Did I go out too hard? It’s possible, but the RPE felt fine. I ran my last marathon to RPE and this one didn’t feel any harder.
Did the VO2 bike workouts help or hinder? If anything, it would be the later. They might have allowed me to run faster than my legs could sustain. </p>
<p>I think the main reason why my Paris marathon was successful and this one wasn’t was due to adherence to the plan. Too many vacations. One injury too many. Too few long runs at marathon pace. Getting the volume up to 90km wasn’t itself sufficient.</p>
<p>If I ever attempt another marathon, I will load up Matt Fitzgerald’s plan stick to it religiously. </p>

<h2 id="training">Training</h2>
<p>I never planned to train for a marathon. It happened by accident. Bike racing is my thing. During the 2020 off season I started running regularly and concluded that completing a marathon was within my grasp. I’d previously dismissed the idea because long training runs in the British winter were not appealing. It’s important for me to enjoy the process of training.</p>
<p>To help me understand the basics of running training I bought Matt Fitzgerald’s book. Throughout Nov-Feb I averaged around 30km each week. In March I increased avg distance to about 60km. The vast majority of runs were zone 2, easy runs.</p>
<p>I entered the Paris marathon in April and decided to buy Matt Fitzgerald’s marathon training plan on Training Peaks. The plan started on 14 June and I followed it to the letter with few exceptions. It meant 5 days of 10-15km slow runs throughout the week with odd fartlek here or there, and a longer run on Sunday.</p>
<p>The longer runs were useful for determining 3 things: a) race nutrition b) race pacing c) race gear. My approach was to use the knowledge I’d gained on the bike, apply it to running, and iterate on it by effecting a series of experiments to answer any race day doubts/questions I had.</p>
<p>My bike fuelling strategy used to be inadequate. I would finish long rides feeling bad, with declining performance, and sometimes stomach cramps. Over the past year or two I learned I could finish rides without performance dropping off by ingesting sufficient carbs. Enough to account for 50% of my caloric burn worked great during my recent rides.</p>
<p>Fuelling a run should be like fuelling a bike ride, right? No. On the morning of my long runs I would fill my water bottles with homemade carb mix (sugar water, sodium citrate, and freshly squeezed lemon for taste). My aim was to shoot for 100-120g of carbs per hour but I couldn’t tolerate it. It was too much water and left me feeling bloated. The lemon resulted in heart burn. And I couldn’t figure out the logistics of carrying all those carbs and water during the race.</p>
<p>I decided to use 60g/hr of SiS gels and rely of water available at water stations. The gels are isotonic which meant that I didn’t need to rely on water to ensure the carbs emptied through my stomach. I practiced my intended strategy several times and it felt fine. No heart burn. No bloating. No GI issues. No perceivable performance decline during &gt; 2hr runs.</p>
<p>How to pace the marathon didn’t become clear to me until after I had run a couple of half marathons. The first of which was in July where I managed finish under 1h30. The second was in September and I was able to further increase my pace to finish in 1h24. My conclusion was that I could run the first half of the marathon in 1h30 and then push for a slightly faster second half.</p>
<p>For the first half marathon I used HR to pace the run. Using Training Peaks I created a workout, uploaded it to my Forerunner so that it would tell me whether I was in the correct HR range. This worked fine but the Forerunner can be distracting when it beeps that your HR isn’t in the right range. It needed a STFU button.</p>
<p>For no specific reason, I ran the second half marathon to RPE whilst glancing at my pace every now and again. I would use this approach for the marathon. It’s simple, and not distracting.</p>
<p>My shoe rotation during training included Rincons; Cliftons; Speed Endorphins; Ultraboosts (these are like clogs); Ghosts. Again, I iterated until the solution became clear. The Sauconys were the most comfortable shoe, and the fastest. A week before the marathon I ran a few laps around the estate where I live to confirm that the Saunconys were indeed faster than the Rincons. They were by far.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the plan my volume was between 80-100k per week. Long runs were 35k, or 2h-2h40. I never ran the full 42k. That felt like too much of an ordeal, the 2h40 runs were enough.</p>
<p>Ideally I wouldn’t have picked up an annoying glute injury 4 weeks from the race. I avoided any speed work for fear for making the injury any worse than it was. To compensate I did a handful of VO2max workouts on the bike trainer.</p>
<p>The only significant deviation from the training plan was removing a 35k run 2 weeks from race day. I felt it would require too much recovery so I replaced it with a zone 2 19k. I did skip hill repeats that were in the plan. The halfs showed me that pace on the climbs wasn’t a limiter.</p>
<p>Looking back I’m not sure I would do anything differently. I set a ton of PBs and ran further and faster than I ever have. My experiments answered all my questions to the extent I was confident on race day.</p>
<h2 id="pre-race">Pre-race</h2>
<p>The travel schedule was as follows: Thursday — 2hr train from Leeds to London; Friday — 2hr train from London to Paris; Saturday — wander around Paris. Sunday — race day. Monday travel home.</p>
<p>I know the importance of being well rested and well fuelled so we paid more for the hotels than I’m normally would for a bit more comfort. This was definitely the right call.</p>
<p>Looking back I would have booked a good restaurant for Saturday evening well in advance. We spent far too long on Saturday afternoon trying to find something. We’re vegan and Paris doesn’t make this easy for us. Everything is either beef, cheese, or beef and cheese. Our meal was nice but contained a bit too much fibre. This upset my stomach later in the evening and I had a few too many trips to the bathroom on Sunday morning. It wasn’t a problem during the race, but I could have done without the worry.</p>
<p>We arrived back at the hotel around 20h. That allowed sufficient time to wind down, check I hadn’t forgotten anything, prep my gear, and attach my race number. I was so fearful of forgetting to stick on my nipple protectors that I put them on the night before.</p>
<p>Breakfast at the hotel was a €16 coffee and a slice of bread and jam. I paid for the convenience, no regrets. I never have anything heavier than that if I know I’m going to be running.</p>
<p>I was in the 3h15 group, and my start time was 9h25. We left the hotel at 8h15 and made the 10min walk to the Champs-Elysées.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful but cold Paris morning. 5º. I wore my down-filled puffer jacket that I would later hand over to my wife 5 mins before start.</p>
<p>Looking back, not sure I would have changed anything except for the restaurant on Saturday night. I would have preferred a big bowl of pasta.</p>
<h2 id="race">Race</h2>
<p>From a performance perspective the race was uneventful.</p>
<p>Gear was: Lulu Fast and Free Run Hat; Lulu Fast and Free tank; Lulu Surge 4” Shorts with liner; Saucony Endorphin Speed 2. I like the Lululemon gear. It’s high quality, and performs great. I don’t need to worry about tickets that scratch or bad fit.</p>
<p>60g/hr of carbs. 9 gels. Eat one 15mins before race start. 4 in my back pocket, 2 in my phone pocket, and 2 in my hands. One thing that I omitted to practice was carrying the gels in the pockets and quickly discovered the 4 in the back pocket was too heavy. They were bouncing around too much. It was annoying. The solution was to take two our and carry two gels in each hand instead of one in each hand.</p>
<p>I’ve been in enough races that pre-race nerves no longer affect me. Experience helps. That doesn’t mean I’m not excited to get going. I just enjoy the music coming from the PA, put on a happy face, and look forward to racing.</p>
<p>The early pace was comfortable, and my watch told me it was around 4:10-4:15/km. I was thinking great! I’ve not set off too quickly and a 90min half is achievable.</p>
<p>I didn’t once look at HR. I would calibrate RPE vs pace and then maintain RPE. I would say the first hour felt like 4-5.</p>
<p>I had a lot of overtaking to do. I started in the 3h15 group and I was aiming for 3hrs. There were several groups following the 3h15 pace makers. I enjoyed leaving them behind.</p>
<p>The atmosphere along the course was amazing. Lots of music. People cheering. Kids hold their hands out for high fives.</p>
<p>I might have run longer than I would have wanted before having my first gel but the first water station was nearer 25mins of running. From that point I’d gulp down a gel and wash it down with a mouthful of water.</p>
<p>Physically and mentally I started hurting at around the 38k mark. RPE was probably up to 7 by that time. I noticed that my pace had a tendency to drop, so I had to pay more attention to my watch to keep the pace up.</p>
<p>For much of the race my Garmin was in predicted finish time mode. Each time I would glance at it, it would read 2h59. I thought I was one whole minute ahead of schedule. However, what I didn’t realise until too late was that the Garmin was announcing the kilometres about one or two hundred metres before reaching the kilometre marker signs. This would mean I would complete the marathon distance on the Garmin 100-200m ahead of the finish line. I would have 30-60s left to run. Crap.</p>
<p>My hamstrings were hurting. Left calf felt like it could cramp at any moment. I was scared of increasing pace too much that the cramp would cripple my race.</p>
<p>2k from the finish, I was hanging on for dear life. My body was begging me to stop. My brain was checking out. RPE was 8-9. I still had a minute in the bank at this point but I wasn’t sure if it was enough. I gave everything I had over the final 2k.</p>
<p>Crossed the finish line. Stopped the Garmin. It read 3h00m15s. Official finish time was 3h00m9s. I’m not going to forget about those 9s any time soon but instead I’ll use them to motivate me during my marathon training next year.</p>
<h2 id="post-race">Post-race</h2>
<p>I don’t think I got much wrong. I got a heck of lot right: pacing; training; gear; choice of first marathon. My km splits were consistent across the race. Even the final two kilometres weren’t that disastrous, being only 10s/km slower than average. I ran an even split, the second half was only 6s slower than the first.</p>
<p>I think I was becoming glycogen depleted towards the end. I might aim for 70g/hr carbs next time. A caffeine gel would have been good near the end too.</p>
<p>My legs started feeling normal on Tuesday. I could barely walk back to the hotel after the marathon.</p>
<p>In hindsight I should have started in the 3h group, but I couldn’t know I was capable of that pace when I entered the marathon.</p>
<p>The summer training was enjoyable so I’m now looking to enter another autumn marathon next year. Perhaps Berlin.</p>

			 <p>Why did I buy these? My wife is a big fan of Ultra Boosts and they were heavily discounted. After 2 runs I’m not sure when or why I’d ever choose to run in these.</p>
<p>The sock-like fit is nice, they’re like putting on slippers. Unfortunately I think I might be faster in slippers.</p>
<p>The Adidas sizing is frustrating. I initially ordered a size too small. In the UK shoes are sold in UK sizes, most of the time. My European size is 46. Unlike Brooks, Saucony, and HokaONEONE, a European size 46 in Adidas land is 11 whereas it’s 10.5 for the other brands.</p>
<p>The toe box is spacious and they do allow in more air than any of the other shoes I own.</p>
<p>It feels like there’s a fair amount of flex in the sole. The heel feels well cushioned but the forefoot feels somewhat uncushioned. Not sure I like this, I prefer my shoes to bit a bit more ridgid.</p>
<p>Weighing 373g, the Ultra Boosts are by far the heaviest running shoes I own. My next heaviest shoe is the Ghost 14, weighing 311g. My 18 month old and worn out Ghost 13s feel better than running in these.</p>
<p>These Ultra Boosts are totally underwhelming.</p>

			 <p>Impressions after a tempo 10k…</p>
<p>The size 46 and the fit is great, the toe box is nice and roomy. I would say I prefer the fit of the Endorphins over my HOKAs. The HOKAs are a close fit.</p>
<p>The shoe itself is nice and light. They might be as fast as the Rincons, but I’ll need to complete a few more runs.</p>
<p>These will likely be part of my regular rotation which currently includes HOKAOneOne Cliftons and Rincons 👍🏻</p>

			 <p>First ever half marathon tomorrow. Aiming for 90mins but the second half is a bit lumpy. We’ll see.
Also using this to test marathon fuelling strategy. 3/4 gels: 60g of glucose. A 375ml water bottle with 50g of sugar (1:1 fructose/glucose), and 250mg of sodium citrate. Aiming to offset a ~1.5L sweat rate with drinking 330ml at each of the water stations. (I’ve spent some time thinking about this).
Hoka Rincon 2 seem to be my preferred shoe these days. They’re light, comfortable, and feel like they improve my running economy more than any other shoe.
